<p>In its initial stages, the FlaSH dashboard (Fig 1b) only enabled me to assess potential anomalies by viewing graphs, line-by-line, as generated by the FlaSH program. There wasn’t an efficient way to filter various incoming anomalies when I needed to examine specific geographic areas or signals. Nor was there an easy way to see a daily overview map of the aggregated average FlaSH scores for nationwide anomalies. Without the current dashboard, I was spending a good amount of time scrolling, manually sorting, documenting, and searching for specific anomaly reports I wanted to examine rather than focusing solely on identifying, marking, and analyzing anomalies.</p>

<p>Now, in its current iteration (Fig 1a), the FlaSH dashboard lets me easily filter daily anomaly results by various variables including geos and signal types, and also view a national map offering a quick glimpse of locations of high FlaSH scores. Furthermore, the updated FlasH dashboard now enables me to take detailed notes on particularly interesting anomalies, trends and other issues of importance, and maintain these notes in an organized, searchable fashion within the platform.</p>
<p>These new dashboard features allow me to devote more of my time and efforts to assessing anomalies of interest and focus on geographies with high concentrations of problematic data or noteworthy trends.</p>
<p>Finally, now with the dashboard’s repositioned filtering menu, the page layout becomes an even more familiar environment. The menu echoes the user-friendly layouts of popular retail and informational sites, making navigation much smore intuitive and smoother, thus allowing me to work through various options more quickly.</p>
