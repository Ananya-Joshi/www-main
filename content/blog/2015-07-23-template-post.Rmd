```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

Each blog post is an R Markdown document. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

For posts where we're using our public data and showing it off, including some
of the code chunks would be great so that readers see how easy it is to use our
data. But for other audiences, it's probably best to use the `echo=FALSE` chunk
option so the code is not included in the post.

### Wide Figure

To create a wide figure, add the `out.extra='class="wide-figure"'` markup:

```{r wide-pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE, out.extra='class="wide-figure"'}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

## Including Math

You can embed mathematics by using dollar signs for inline math and double
dollars for display math: $x = \sum_{i=1}^n i$,

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Metadata

Each post has a title, author, date, and tags. 
Choose bold, active titles, like "Delphi releases new survey data",
rather than boring titles like "New survey aggregates".

The author metadata should credit the post author or authors; But in the post acknowledgements, 
you should also generously
name anyone who helped with parts of your post, e.g., the team members who
obtained data or set up a server or developed a package you use.

### Tags

Each post can be tagged, as you can see in the metadata block at the top. I
suggest we consider the following tags as base tags:

- forecasting
- nowcasting
- symptom surveys
- medical records
- COVIDcast API
- COVIDcast map
- data sources (for everthing else than symptom surveys and medical records)
- news (for announcements of new features, new models, etc.)
- R (for posts containing R, typically, our covidcast R package)
- Python (for posts containing Python, typically, our covicast Python package)

## Linking

### Linking to other pages and blog posts:

using the file name and the Hugo shortcodes, e.g.: [Facebook Post](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("relref", "2020-08-26-fb-survey")`).
Jumping to a specific section/anchor is supported too: 
[previous exploratory investigations](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("relref", "2020-08-26-fb-survey#some-interesting-examples")`)

### Linking to the API doc:

there is another shortcode for creating an api link, e.g. 
[public API](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "/")`) or
[Doctor's Visits signal](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast-signals/doctor-visits.html")`)
