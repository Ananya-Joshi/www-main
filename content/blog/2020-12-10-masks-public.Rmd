As COVID cases and deaths continue to rise in the United States, we are
repeatedly reminded that unless we take the appropriate precautions---by wearing
masks when around other people, by working from home whenever possible, by
avoiding travel and crowded places---there will be a high rate of COVID deaths.
Vaccines are on their way, but until they arrive, we must continue social
distancing. But as we consider the precautions we've already taken, and the
sacrifices we have made in our lives during 2020, it's natural to ask: Why
haven't these precautions prevented the current COVID spike? If everyone is
wearing masks, why are cases increasing?

To answer this question, we must first ask: *Is* everyone wearing masks? And are
*enough* people wearing masks? In this post we'll show how Delphi's COVID
symptom surveys can help answer these questions, and how they can enable
important research about the pandemic and its spread.

## Studying Mask Use with Surveys

Since April, and in partnership with Facebook Data for Good and the University
of Maryland, Delphi has [conducted daily surveys of Facebook
users](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("ref", "2020-08-26-fb-survey")`)
throughout the United States. These surveys ask respondents about their
experiences during the pandemic, and ask whether they're experiencing symptoms,
whether they are isolating or following precautions, and how they have been
affected by the pandemic. They survey has been completed 14 million times since
April, allowing us an unprecedented level of insight into COVID and people's
experiences, down to individual counties around the country.

[Since in early
September](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("ref", "2020-10-06-survey-wave-4")`)
we have asked all respondents a question about mask use:

> In the past 5 days, how often did you wear a mask when in public?
>
> 1. All the time
> 2. Most of the time
> 3. Some of the time
> 4. A little of the time
> 5. None of the time
> 6. I have not been in public during the past 5 days

Early analysis suggests that in most states, mask usage is high, and in those
where it was lower, it has been gradually increasing. For example, the graph
below shows the percentage of respondents who answer "Most of the time" or "All
of the time" in six states (including DC). In three of these (the District of
Columbia, Massachusetts, and New York), mask usage is among the highest in the
country; in the other three (South Dakota, Idaho, and Wyoming), it's among the
lowest.

```{r state_masks_time, message=FALSE}
library(covidcast)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(directlabels)

states_of_interest <- c("dc", "ma", "ny", "wy", "sd", "id")

state_masks <- covidcast_signal(
    "fb-survey", "smoothed_wwearing_mask",
    start_day = "2020-09-15", end_day = "2020-11-30",
    geo_type = "state", geo_values = states_of_interest
)

ggplot(state_masks, aes(x = time_value, y = value, color = geo_value)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_dl(aes(label = toupper(geo_value)), method = "last.points") +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                 date_labels = "%b %Y",
                 date_minor_breaks = "1 week") +
    labs(x = "Date", y = "% wearing masks in public most/all the time",
         title = "Self-reported public mask usage",
         subtitle = "From Delphi's surveys, conducted through Facebook",
         caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
    theme_bw() +
    guides(color = FALSE)
```

Despite the gap between states, it also seems clear that self-reported mask use
has been on the rise in states whose mask use started low. This is quite
encouraging.

(Note that, as with most of Delphi's blog posts, all the code and data used to
make these plots is available---simply click the Code button to see how our [API
clients](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast_clients.html")`)
make it easy to access aggregated data.)

Seeing these numbers---particularly the very high reported mask usage in many
states---might make you wonder: If mask usage is over 80% in most states, and
over 90% in many, why does the rate of new COVID cases in the United States
currently look like this?

```{r national_cases_time, message=FALSE}
cases <- covidcast_signal("indicator-combination",
                          "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num",
                          start_day = "2020-09-15", end_day = "2020-11-30",
                          geo_type = "state")

cases %>%
    group_by(time_value) %>%
    summarize(cases = sum(value)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_value, y = cases)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                 date_labels = "%b %Y",
                 date_minor_breaks = "1 week") +
    labs(x = "Date", y = "Reported new cases",
         title = "Number of reported new cases per day",
         subtitle = "7-day rolling average",
         caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
    theme_bw()
```

To answer this important question, we must ask:

1. Do the surveys reliably measure mask use in public? If they are biased in
   some way, perhaps mask use is not as common as they suggest.
2. How much mask use is necessary to prevent cases? If some people do not wear
   masks, and they interact with each other, they may spread COVID. Also, masks
   *reduce* risk; they do not eliminate it. If people are working indoors around
   others, hosting social events, dining indoors, and so on, but wearing masks,
   they are nonetheless at greater risk than people who do none of those things.

## Potential Survey Biases

To answer the first question, we must consider what kinds of biases could affect
the surveys:

* **Sampling bias.** Survey respondents are sampled from Facebook users, but
  Facebook users may not be representative of the United States population.
  Facebook [produces survey weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14675) designed
  to help us adjust the survey to match the population's age and gender
  distribution, but there could be other factors besides age and gender that
  differ between Facebook users and the United States population generally.
* **Non-response bias.** The survey is voluntary---recruited users are shown an
  invitation in their News Feed, but can opt not to click on it---and so people
  who take the survey might be different in some way. For example, perhaps the
  people who take the survey are more concerned about COVID than those who
  choose not to, and hence are more likely to wear masks than the general
  population. Facebook's weights also try to account for this by estimating the
  probability that each person will respond, but it's difficult to verify that
  this probability is estimated correctly.
* **Social desirability bias.** It's well-known that survey respondents can
  choose answers that seem socially desirable. That is, if mask usage is widely
  accepted and there is immense social pressure to comply, someone who does not
  usually wear a mask may feel pressure to say they do on a survey. This effect
  is likely smaller on an anonymous online survey than it would be in person,
  but it could still be present.
* **Incorrect responses.** Some survey respondents may deliberately give
  incorrect answers, because when you post something on the Internet, inevitably
  someone will try to mess with it. Sometimes this is easy to detect (e.g.
  people indicating that they are experiencing *every* symptom of a list of 16,
  or that they have -20 family members), but not always.

These biases are hard to directly measure. We don't have a way to tell if a
respondent is truthful, and since there's no objective national data on the
exact percentage of people who are wearing masks in public, we have no way to
check exactly how biased results could be. ([Some cities are collecting
interesting
data](https://bloombergcities.medium.com/how-philadelphia-is-cracking-the-code-for-measuring-mask-compliance-7ace18daa9a9),
though!)

Instead, we chose a different way to verify our mask use estimates. In late
November, we added a new mask question to the survey:

> In the past 7 days, when out in public places where social distancing is not
> possible, about how many people would you estimate wore masks?
>
> 1. All of the people were wearing masks
> 2. Most of the people were wearing masks
> 3. Some of the people were wearing masks
> 4. A few of the people were wearing masks
> 5. None of the people were wearing masks
> 6. I have not been out in public places in the past 7 days

Because this question asks about *other* people, it bypasses social desirability
bias. And even if the survey sample is not representative, as long as the
respondents visit representative public places (like grocery stores or public
transit) and see *other* people there, we may get a better estimate of public
mask use.

Let's see how the data looks.

```{r mask_questions_compared, message=FALSE}
masked <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_wearing_mask",
                           start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                           geo_type = "state")
other_mask <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "wip_smoothed_others_masked",
                               start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                               geo_type = "state")

joined <- masked %>%
    inner_join(other_mask, by = "geo_value", suffix = c(".self", ".other"))

p_most <- function(base_rate) {
  N <- 10
  frac <- 0.8

  pbinom(frac * N, size = N, prob = base_rate / 100,
         lower.tail = FALSE) * 100
}

ggplot(joined, aes(x = value.self, y = value.other,
                   label = toupper(geo_value))) +
  geom_text() +
  ## geom_function(fun = p_most) +
  labs(x = "% who report wearing masks most/all the time",
       y = "% who report most/all others wear masks",
       title = "Mask use reported in symptom survey",
       subtitle = "December 1st, 2020",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

There are a few things worthy of note. There is clearly a strong relationship
here---but notice that in South Dakota and Wyoming, where over 80% report they
wear masks most or all of the time, fewer than half of respondents agree that
most or all *other* people wear masks in public places. Only in a few states do
over 90% of respondents agree that most other people wear masks:

```{r}
joined %>%
  filter(value.other >= 90) %>%
  arrange(desc(value.other)) %>%
  select(geo_value, value.other) %>%
  mutate(geo_value = abbr_to_name(geo_value, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("State", "% agree that most/all others are masked"),
               digits = 1)
```

But we should also be careful in interpreting this. In South Dakota and Wyoming,
fewer than half of respondents agree that most or all other people wear masks.
That's not the same thing as saying that fewer than half of people wear masks.
For example, if people interpret "most people wear masks" to mean "I only see
one or two people not wearing masks when I'm in public", "most" could correspond
to 80 or 90% mask use, rather than just 50%; it's not obvious how to translate
the survey question into an estimate of the percent of people wearing masks. So
what can we learn from this?

## A Probabilistic Argument for Mask Use

Permit me to discuss some probability theory for a moment. It's fine if you
don't follow the math---the key point will be the probability it allows me to
calculate two paragraphs from now.

Suppose that the true proportion of people who wear masks in public in a certain
state is $p$. Suppose those people are uniformly distributed throughout the
state. If you go out in a public place and see 20 people, the number of those
people who are wearing masks is a random variable $X$ with distribution
$\text{Binomial}(20, p)$.

Suppose $p = 0.8$, meaning 80% of people wear masks. With a bit of math, we
find that on a typical trip into public, the chance of seeing **at least 4
people** not wearing masks is $\Pr(X \leq 16)$, or
**`r round(pbinom(3, size=20, prob=0.2, lower.tail = FALSE))`%.**

This means that the apparent contradiction we saw in the graph above---with
respondents claiming that they wear masks but disputing that most others
do---may not be a contradiction. Depending on how respondents interpret "most",
it might be expected. After all, if you wear a mask yourself but then run into
four different people who do not while getting groceries, you could be quite
justified in denying that "most" people wear masks.

But more importantly, this shows **why a high rate of mask use is so
important.** If 80% of people wear masks, you are still likely to run into
several unmasked people on a trip to any public place, placing you at higher
risk. The problem only gets worse if our assumption that mask use is uniformly
distributed is false, and if people without masks tend to visit the same
locations or events.

There are, in short, numerous opportunities for COVID transmission even when
over three-quarters of people wear masks. Only a very high rate of mask usage
can dramatically reduce these opportunities.

## Public Activities, Social Distancing, and Masks

Earlier, I pointed out that mask use *reduces* the risk of COVID transmission,
but does not eliminate it. This is why authorities such as the Centers for
Disease Control, and most state health departments, recommend social distancing
together with mask use. This means we can't simply compare states by their level
of mask use to see if masks are working; we must also compare their level of
social distancing.

Our survey asks respondents a series of questions about activities, by asking
"In the last 24 hours, have you done any of the following?" One possible choice
is "Spent time with someone who isn't currently staying with you"; whether this
is done with a mask or not, it represents a higher risk. And the data shows that
it's more often done in states where fewer people report wearing masks:

```{r social_distancing, message=FALSE}
spent_time <- covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "wip_smoothed_wspent_time_1d",
                               start_day = "2020-12-01", end_day = "2020-12-01",
                               geo_type = "state")

mask_time <- masked %>%
  inner_join(spent_time, by = "geo_value", suffix = c(".mask", ".others"))

ggplot(mask_time,
       aes(x = value.mask, y = value.others, label = toupper(geo_value))) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(x = "% who report wearing masks most/all the time",
       y = "% who spent time with others in past 24 hours",
       title = "Social distancing reported in symptom survey",
       subtitle = "December 1st, 2020",
       caption = "Data from Delphi COVIDcast, delphi.cmu.edu") +
  theme_bw()
```

This suggests that lower mask use is correlated with other risky behaviors,
which combine to produce more opportunities to spread the virus. While this
graph only shows one possible activity, our survey asks about others---including
working outside the home, visiting bars and restaurants, and attending large
events---and our API allows researchers to quickly combine it with [SafeGraph's
mobility data](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html")`)
and other data sources that give a
clearer picture of how people react to the pandemic.

## More Opportunities in Survey Data

Above, we've seen how our survey data can shed light on mask use in the United
States. Insights like these are important: Using this information about mask use
and activity, authorities can target their emergency orders and provide more
specific advice to the public. Meanwhile, public health researchers can combine
this data with other sources to study how the pandemic spreads and what
interventions are most effective to stop it.

All of the data used above is publicly available---see our [COVIDcast Epidata
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) for details
on how to get it. Numerous aggregates from the survey data, including more
measures of public activity, are [available through the
API](`r blogdown::shortcode_html("apiref", "api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html")`).

We also make the raw response data available to academic and nonprofit
researchers, and we look forward to seeing more detailed analyses of this data.
For example, it would be important to know if people who do not wear masks are
more likely to do activities near other people, such as attending public events
or spending time with friends who do not live with them, than those who wear
masks regularly. Our survey asks respondents about these types of activities,
allowing us to understand how behavior varies. If you're an academic or
nonprofit researcher and want to do this kind of research, check out our [survey
documentation to get
started](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/).
