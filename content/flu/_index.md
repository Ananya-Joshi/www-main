Delphi systems developed before the COVID-19 pandemic typically target seasonal Influenza ("Flu"), but often are used to study other diseases including Chikungunya, Dengue, and Norovirus.

# About Flu Forecasting

Since 2013, Delphi has supported the U.S. CDC’s Influenza Division in advancing and growing a scientific community around influenza forecasting. That year, we participated in the CDC’s inaugural “[Predict the Influenza Season Challenge](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/predict-flu-challenge.htm).” We’ve been perennial leaders in forecasting accuracy ever since, taking part in further [flu forecasting challenges](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/about-flu-forecasting.htm), and in 2019 being designated a [National Center of Excellence for Influenza Forecasting](https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/center-of-excellence/). It is a CDC-funded and CDC-designated center working on advancing influenza forecasting, and enabling and improving the usefulness of forecasts of both seasonal and pandemic influenza.

## Flu Tools

### [Epidata](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/)
The Epidata API, originally released in 2016, provides real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data. Epidata’s influenza and dengue signals served as the precursor for our COVIDCast system. In this system, we compile data from unique sources and extract flu-related signals, among others.

### [EpiVis](https://delphi.cmu.edu/epivis/)
EpiVis is an interactive tool for visualizing epidemiological time-series data. Users may explore their own data or utilize existing time series from the numerous data sources provided by the EpiData API.

### [ILI Nearby](https://delphi.cmu.edu/nowcast/)
ILI Nearby is a flu nowcasting system which utilizes sensor fusion methodology to bring together multiple signals to nowcast (estimate in real-time) the prevalence of Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) in various geographic areas of the US. **Note:** ILI Nearby has not been actively maintained since 2019 and should no longer be relied upon for accurate nowcasting.

# About Other Pathogens

Delphi has also worked on modeling for other pathogens, namely Dengue fever, Norovirus, and Chikungunya. More information about our data on those pathogens is available in our [Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/README.html).
