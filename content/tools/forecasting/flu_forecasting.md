We participate in the weekly Flu forecasting hub run by the CDC during the flu season. Our current system for generating forecasts can be found [here](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/flu-hosp-forecast/). 
From these dozens of individual forecasts by various groups, the CDC publishes a weekly [ensemble prediction](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm).
