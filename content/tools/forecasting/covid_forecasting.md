We participate in weekly COVID hospital admissions forecasting at the state and national level.
Our current system for generating forecasts can be found [here](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covid-hosp-forecast).
In addition to publishing the individual forecasts from the participating groups, the Reich lab makes an ensemble prediction, and hosts a [visualization of both](https://viz.covid19forecasthub.org).
We host a comparison tool for [retrospective analysis of the forecasters](https://delphi.cmu.edu/forecast-eval/).
