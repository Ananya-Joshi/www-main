State-level real-time estimates (nowcasts) of ILI (influenza-like illness)

**Note:** This system is designed to nowcast ILI driven by seasonal
influenza and is NOT designed to nowcast ILI during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
are only keeping it running as others may be relying on it. We are working on
a new system for COVID-19.
