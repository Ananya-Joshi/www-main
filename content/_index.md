### Our Mission

Epidemiological forecasting is critically needed for decision making
by public health officials, commercial and non-commercial
institutions, and the general public. The Delphi group at Carnegie
Mellon University focuses on developing the technological capability
of epi-forecasting, and its role in decision making, both public and
private. Our long term vision is to make epidemiological forecasting
as universally accepted and useful as weather forecasting is today.
