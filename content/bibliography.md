We found the following publications to be particularly relevant to epi-forcasting. This list is work-in-progress and not meant to ever be exhaustive. We share it here in the hope that anyone looking for recent epi-forecasting literature will have a place to start. If there is a particular publication that you think ought to be included, please [let us know](mailto:dfarrow@andrew.cmu.edu).
