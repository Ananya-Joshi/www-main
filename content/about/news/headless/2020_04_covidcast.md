We launched our [COVIDcast system]({{< relref "covidcast">}}), which makes available indicators related to COVID-19 activity level across the U.S. These indicators are derived from a variety of anonymized, aggregated data sources made available by multiple partners, and are publicly available at the [COVIDcast endpoint]({{< apiref "api/covidcast.html">}}) of our [Epidata API]({{< apiref "api/README.html">}}).
