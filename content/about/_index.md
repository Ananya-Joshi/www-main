### Who are we?

We're a research group based out of Carnegie Mellon University dedicated to developing the theory and practice of epidemic tracking and forecasting. Pre-pandemic we worked mostly on influenza, dengue and norovirus; we've now picked up a focus on COVID. We procure unique data streams that reflect epidemic (or pandemic) activity, extract relevant indicators, and make these publicly and continuously available. We and others then use these indicators for nowcasting (situational awareness) and short-term forecasting.

### Who is our audience?

Public health authorities (federal, state, local), the healthcare industry, the public and private sectors, fellow researchers working on epidemic tracking and forecasting, data journalists, and the general public.

### Delphi's milestones

- Since 2013, we've supported the U.S. CDC's Influenza Division in advancing and growing a [scientific community around influenza forecasting](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html). We've been [perennial leaders in forecasting accuracy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roni/CDC%20Flu%20Challenge%202014-2018%20Results.pdf).

- Since 2016, we've developed the [Delphi Epidata API]({{< apiref "/" >}}), which provides real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data.

- Since 2016, we've been providing [influenza nowcasts](https://delphi.cmu.edu/nowcast/) to the CDC, states' departments of health, and the public.

- Since 2019, we've been working directly with the CDC as a National Center of Excellence for Influenza Forecasting (a 5-year designation).

- Since March 2020, we've created and maintained the [nation's largest public repository of diverse, real-time indicators of COVID-19 activity]({{< relref "covidcast" >}}) in the U.S. Our indicators are freely available through a [public API]({{< apiref "api/covidcast.html" >}}).

- Several of the underlying data sources (on which these indicators are built) would not exist or be publicly available without our efforts. This includes:

  - A massive [national daily survey]({{< relref "surveys">}}) we're running in [partnership with Facebook](https://covid-survey.dataforgood.fb.com/survey_and_map_data.html). Over 20 million Americans have answered the survey since April 2020, providing real-time insights into, e.g., self-reported symptoms, mask wearing, testing, contacts, and vaccination.

  - An enormous database of medical insurance claims that have been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA privacy regulations, covering more than half the U.S. population. This data is made available by health system partners including Change Healthcare, and provides insights into disease activity through outpatient visits and hospitalizations.

- Since April 2020, we've been supporting and advising the CDC in their community-driven COVID-19 forecasting effort, which includes creating and evaluating an ensemble forecast from the 70+ forecasts under submission that serves as the basis for the [CDC's official COVID-19 forecast communications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).
