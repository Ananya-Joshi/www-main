In March 2020, the [Delphi group]({{< relref "/" >}}) at Carnegie Mellon 
University launched the [COVIDcast project]({{< relref "covidcast" >}}), a 
comprehensive effort to:

- build and maintain new data streams and indicators that reflect COVID-19 
  activity and burden, 
- make that data available to researchers, journalists, and the public through a
  [public API]({{< apiref "covidcast.html">}}) 
  and [packages for R and 
  Python]({{< apiref "covidcast_clients.html">}}), 
- build [interactive maps and graphics]({{< relref "covidcast" >}}) to inform 
  decision makers and the public, and 
- develop forecasts of the future spread of the pandemic and healthcare demand.

Through this blog, we'll describe our work, share interesting results, and 
engage with other researchers helping to fight the pandemic.
