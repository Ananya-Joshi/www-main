Delphi’s Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence was established in 2019. It is a CDC funded and CDC-designated Center of Excellence working on advancing influenza forecasting, enabling and improving the usefulness of forecasts of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our goal is to inform public health responses and policy developments at the national, regional, and state levels. Another goal is to inform the general public, providing reliable short term forecasts that increase the credibility of and trust in public health authorities, bridging between greater adherence to recommendations and trustworthy information. 

Our forecast can help inform decision-making concerning behavior and exposure of flu-vulnerable populations (e.g., the elderly, the young, the pregnant, and the immunocompromised). Through our Center of Excellence, Delphi aims to overcome inherent latencies in traditional surveillance, bringing nowcasting and short-term forecasting to the forefront with a few weeks’ advance notice and the goal to save many lives.
